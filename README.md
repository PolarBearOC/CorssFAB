# CrossFAB
A Cross-Platform Floating Action Button and Menu for Xamarin.Forms, made entirely in Forms without renderers.

### Disclaimer
This project lacks a lot of features that I'd like to add at some point, therefore I didn't turn it into a NuGet yet. It serves mostly as an example for the implementation of such control.

# Usage
To use it properly, place the control as the last element in your page, and align it to the bottom right/left in a grid.
As I do plan to update this project, more detailed will come soon.

# Contribution
If you have any idea for a feature, or if you found any problem, please open an issue and I'll address it as soon as I can.

Please do open pull requests for features you'd like to see, since currently I'm more invested in other projects and won't have much time to implement the features myself.

# License
This project is under MIT license, meaning it's completely open-source and free to use and edit in any type of project. Feel free to clone, fork, and mess around with the code.
